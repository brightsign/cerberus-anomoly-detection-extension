# wherever `-d <dir>` points. Because every project resolves the SAME absolute
# CACHE_DIR/sdk path, one correct install serves them all; copying in an SDK
# relocated for a different path silently breaks the build.

No cross-compile SDK found in the shared cache, and no toolchain installer on hand.

The SDK is provisioned once per build box by the brightsign-sdk-builder repo,
which downloads the BrightSign OS source, builds the custom SDK, and installs it
into the shared cache this repo reads. From a checkout parallel to this one:

    cd ../brightsign-sdk-builder && make build

That populates ${SDK_DIR}. Then re-run this build.

Alternatively, if you already have a brightsign-x86_64-cobra-toolchain-*.sh
installer, install from it directly:
    - pass its path:  make fetch-sdk SDK_INSTALLER=/path/to/installer.sh
    - or drop it in the shared cache dir (see 'make cache-info') or the repo root.

Do NOT symlink or copy in an already-extracted sdk/ directory relocated for a
different path -- its baked paths will fail. Always install with -d pointed at the
shared cache path so OE relocation bakes the right path in.
